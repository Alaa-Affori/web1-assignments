        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Ala'a Affori, a CAP student at An-Najah National University. My enthusiasm for technological advancements 
            motivates me to join this program. Beyond my academic interests, I am deeply committed to voluntary work. For example,
            I volunteered as a Content Writer and Secretary at the IEEE An-Najah Student Branch, where I had the honor of being selected 
            as the IEEE Day Ambassador in 2022. Additionally, I volunteered at the language resource center (LRC), teaching Arabic to
            international volunteers. I find joy and fulfillment in volunteering and making a positive impact in my community as I 
            believe in the power of collaboration!

        <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
            As I look toward the future, I find myself grappling with uncertainty about my career path. 
            I am still confused about whether I want to delve into the field of software development, explore 
            the exciting possibilities of artificial intelligence, or take a different direction altogether. 
            Additionally, I ponder whether to pursue higher education further or jump directly into the workforce. 
            Each option holds its appeal, and the possibilities seem endless. Ultimately, I hope to find a path 
            that not only challenges me but also aligns with my passions and aspirations.
